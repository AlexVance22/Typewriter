		<div class="Title">THE PLANE CRASH</div>
		<div class="Subtitle">By Alex Vance</div>
	</div>
	<div class="Page">
		<div class="SceneNum">&nbsp;&nbsp;1 </div><div class="Scene">EXT. MOUNTAINTOP, AFTERMATH OF CRASH - MORNING</div>
		<div class="Directorial">From a first person view we see Alex blink to life. He grunts and stands up before taking in his surroundings.</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Parenthetical">(Under his breath)</div>
		<div class="Speech">What the fuck?</div>
		<div class="Directorial">He pauses for a while before noticing Senc buried close by. He quickly runs over to him to unbury him.</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Speech">Wake up, wake up dumbass, we gotta vlog!</div>
		<div class="SceneNum">&nbsp;&nbsp;2 </div><div class="Scene">EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - MIDDAY</div>
		<div class="Directorial">Senc is standing dramatically on a small hill with the mountain towering over him. He speaks directly to the viewer.</div>
		<div class="Name">SENC</div>
		<div class="Speech">This massive mountain, spanning all the way from someway over here to somewhere over there, is quite magnificent. So magnificent in fact, that one might even expect an airplane pilot to see it while he flies towards it, wouldn't you say Alex?</div>
		<div class="Directorial">The camera turns to reveal Alex off to the side. He is crouched and appears to be digging.</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Speech">Oh yeah, very imposing.</div>
		<div class="Directorial">Pans back to Senc.</div>
		<div class="Name">SENC</div>
		<div class="Speech">We think we might be somewhere in the Pyrenees, though honestly, we have no idea. All instruments are fried, and so far, nobody we've dug up has been... well... alive.</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Speech">Wait hold that thought, the pilot's responding.</div>
		<div class="Directorial">We cut to looking over Alex's shoulder, and realise that he was digging up an Italian looking man who seems to be frozen solid. The camera slowly zooms in on him</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Speech">What's he saying?</div>
		<div class="Name">SENC</div>
		<div class="Speech">I don't know, I can't make it out.</div>
		<div class="Name">PILOT</div>
		<div class="Parenthetical">(Feebly)</div>
		<div class="Speech">Gorlaamiiiiiiii...</div>
		<div class="SceneNum">&nbsp;&nbsp;3 </div><div class="Scene">EXT. CLIFFSIDE CAMP - MIDDAY</div>
		<div class="Directorial">Alex faces the audience, the valley stretching out behind him.</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Speech">It seems that, against all odds, our pilot was the only other person on board to survive the fall.</div>
		<div class="Directorial">We cut to show Senc attempting to first aid the pilot, but he has misunderstood his intentions and is reacting violently and screaming in Italian. Alex continues to narrate.</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Speech">This would of course be much more advantageuos if the man spoke any language except Italian.</div>
		<div class="Directorial">The face cam switches to Senc in the same spot.</div>
		<div class="Name">SENC</div>
		<div class="Speech">Do I want to kill him? No, no I don't. Am I starving out in an unknown mountain range as a result of him crashing my plane to Madrid? Yes. Has he snapped two of my frostbitten fingers? Yes. But do I want to kill him?</div>
		<div class="Directorial">Eye contact is held with the camera for an uncomfortably long time. It then suddenly pans to reveal that the pilot was standing just out of frame the entire time.</div>
		<div class="SceneNum">&nbsp;&nbsp;4 </div><div class="Scene">EXT. ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN - AFTERNOON</div>
		<div class="Directorial">The travellers continue to trek throughout the bitter cold of the forest, portrayed by a montage of different moments including walking, foraging and squabbling.</div>
		<div class="Name">NARRATOR</div>
		<div class="Speech">And so began the great march in the hopes of escaping the unknown. The bitter cold eating at their extremities and their food supplies slowly dwindling, the three unlikely companions slowly began to go insane.</div>
		<div class="Directorial">Every so often, the face of the pilot fades in and scrolls across the scenery, with Italian mutterings blending with the voice of the narrator. As the three wander into the distance, we fade to black.</div>
		<div class="SceneNum">&nbsp;&nbsp;5 </div><div class="Scene">EXT. EDGE OF UNKNOWN VILLAGE - LATE AFTERNOON</div>
		<div class="Directorial">Senc speaks to the viewers through a selfie video recorded on his phone.</div>
		<div class="Name">SENC</div>
		<div class="Speech">Alright, so we've just found the first sign of civilisation in a long while and we're now going to follow them as far as they go. If we're lucky they may lead us somewhere with wifi, then we can then use google to find the nearest hawk tower, and from there we can send a letter back home so they can send help. Let's hope.</div>
		<div class="Directorial">The pilot then walks into frame behind Senc and starts harassing him, yelling as he does so, but before long, Senc shuts him up with a swift punch.</div>
		<div class="SceneNum">&nbsp;&nbsp;6 </div><div class="Scene">EXT. UNKNOWN VILLAGE, AMONG A LARGE CROWD - EVENING</div>
		<div class="Directorial">Now travelling as two, Alex and Senc attempt to blend in with the crowd they have joined.</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Speech">Greetings fellow traveller. I'm just a normal tourist such as yourself, but I do believe I've lost my way around these here treacherous parts. I don't suppose you could remind me where we're going?</div>
		<div class="Name">FRIENDLY LOCAL</div>
		<div class="Parenthetical">(In Spanish)</div>
		<div class="Parenthetical">Just who the hell are you exaclty? I've never seen you before in my life. We all payed good money for this tour.</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Parenthetical">(Having not understood a single word)</div>
		<div class="Speech">I thank you heartily for your service.</div>
		<div class="Directorial">He then turns to the camera.</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Speech">Let's go.</div>
		<div class="SceneNum">&nbsp;&nbsp;7 </div><div class="Scene">INT. CHEAP HOTEL & BAR - NIGHT</div>
		<div class="Directorial">There is a jovial atmosphere about as a group of strangers all walk in from the cold to enjoy a beer or two or three or more. The general drunkenness rises with the volume of the music. Chaos. Alex decides after a while that he needs to go to the bathroom. We see him walk there in first person again. Once he's finished he looks himself in the mirror. In a moment of clarity he remembers the pilot and is thrown into panic. Quickly he runs back into the bar and grabs Senc.</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Speech">Senc we lost the pilot.</div>
		<div class="Name">SENC</div>
		<div class="Parenthetical">(Very drunk)</div>
		<div class="Speech">...W- What?</div>
		<div class="Name">ALEX</div>
		<div class="Speech">The pilot. We lost him somewhere in the mountains. We have to go find him.</div>
		<div class="Name">SENC</div>
		<div class="Speech">Oh- Ooooooh no! What are we gonna do? Where could he possibly be? I truly do hope he is alright. Dear god the poor thing...</div>
		<div class="Directorial">After running back the way they came for a good while, they dig around in the snow for what feels like an eternity, but slowly give up hope of ever finding their "beloved" pilot again.</div>
		<div class="SceneNum">&nbsp;&nbsp;8 </div><div class="Scene">EXT. HILLTOP FUNERAL - DAY</div>
		<div class="Directorial">Alex and Senc are stood atop a grassy hill, hands on their hearts, looking up at the sky. Trumpets play in the background. As the funeral progresses, the two seem increasingly disinterested.</div>
		<div class="Name">NARRATOR</div>
		<div class="Speech">Out there, buried in the icy cold, there ends the tale of this airplane pilot.</div>
		<div class="Directorial">Fade to black.</div>
		<div class="Directorial"></div>
		<div class="Name">THE END</div>
