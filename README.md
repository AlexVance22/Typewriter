# TypeWriter screenplay editor
### Or: I wanted to write movies, but I am broke.

***

This project was really only supposed to take a couple of days, but as always, I got carried away. On the plus side, all required features are now fully implemented, albeit with some fun quirks, expecially when it comes to text wrapping.

Features:
- Text editor with screenplay autoformatting
- Style prediction when adding a new block
- Internal saving as HTML
- Export to PDF or HTML (CSS provided for standalone formatting)

Coming soon:
- Scene list menu
- Jump-to functionality for scenes
- Character list menu
- Autocomplete for character names

Coming sometime maybe:
- Location, casting and scheduling managers
